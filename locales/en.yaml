  I will help create a quote from a post.
  Bot can work both in private messages and in groups.

    <b>⚙️ Available commands:</b>
  /q — make a quote from the message <i>[reply to the message]</i>

  To create a quote from several messages, write as a parameter a number that will indicate how many messages should be in the quote.
  In private messages, you can forward several messages to me at once and I will make a quote from them.
